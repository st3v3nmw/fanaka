..  rubric:: Practise looking more deeply, from what people say to what they really need.

You probably realise that throughout life, what people communicate shouldn't only be taken at face-value.

Learning to identify what really matters from what they say matters is a valuable skill (and therefore it requires practice).

It applies when job-seeking too. If you are able to look beyond what people say to the deeper needs they are trying to express, you'll give yourself more opportunities for success.


Asks, wants and needs
================================

For example, a job description demands "three years' Python web agency experience".

When you read through a job description, obviously you need to take close note what they actually ask for, and take it seriously too.

But be aware that **what they ask for is not necessarily what they want, and what they want is not necessarily what they need**. So use your judgement, imagination and insight too.

..  sidebar::

    When they ask for something, consider what they really want.

Ask yourself - or even ask *them*, if you have the opportunity - *why* they want it. And when they say they want something, ask why they *need* it.

You will often get interesting and revealing answers, that show you extra options and opportunities, and even open doors that seemed to be closed.

They *asked for* "three years' Python web agency experience". Perhaps you have that, or not. Either way, think about what it says about what they *want*.

They want evidence of Python web experience, almost certainly. And most likely they *want* someone who has proven ability to deal with customer requests, deadlines and so on - and you might be able to show that, even if you can't show precisely what they asked for.

..  sidebar::

    Then, think about what they actually *need*.

Very often, prospective employers want proof and evidence, signs that you are going to have the right skills, abilities and attitudes in the job. The signs that they want might not be the only ones that could should that you have what they *need*.

Why do they want the things they want? What needs do you see revealed? What else do you have that could be evidence you will be able to meet the needs?

In this particular case, they want evidence of Python web experience, and of ability to work with customers' needs.

Reading between the lines, listening carefully how they talk about it, you might come to the conclusion that what they really *need* is someone who is good at coming up with pragmatic prototypes.

Or, you might do a bit of digging and discover that they need to have more people on a big Django project that is expected to go through several phases of development, with a customer whose own plans are subject to change.

And that gives you something else you can talk about and show, if you are prepared for it.


Be tactful
==========

Making judgements about what people "really" want or need is a skill.

If you talk about it, you have to do it tactfully and deftly. Nobody wants to employ a condescending know-it-all who airily informs an interviewer that though they ask for *x*, what they really need is *y*.

But, you can respectfully explore those questions ("Why is the agency experience so important for this role?"), and show that you have thought about them. It's good to look below the surface of things.
