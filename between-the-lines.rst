        :ref:`How to contribute <contribute>`

..  rubric:: Practise looking more deeply, from what people say to what they really need.

You probably realise that throughout life, what people communicate shouldn't only be taken at face-value.

Learning to identify what really matters from what they say matters is a valuable skill (and therefore it requires practice).

It applies when job-seeking too. If you are able to look beyond what people say to the deeper needs they are trying to express, you'll give yourself more opportunities for success.


Asks, wants and needs
================================

A colleague for example, or a job description, might ask for something. Take that seriously: listen carefully, and pay attention to what job descriptions say.

But be aware that **what they ask for is not necessarily what they want, and what they want is not necessarily what they need**. So use your judgement, imagination and insight too.

Ask yourself - or even ask *them*, if you have the opportunity - *why* they want it. And when they say they want something, ask why they *need* it.

You will often get interesting and revealing answers, that show you extra options and opportunities, and even open doors that seemed to be closed.


Example: your manager
---------------------

Let's say your manager says: "I want a daily meeting with progress reports from *everyone* on the xxx project!"

..  sidebar::

    When they ask for something, consider what they really want.

What they're asking for is clear. Ask yourself: is that really want they *want*? It certainly sounds like your manager wants to be kept closely up-to-date with progress. They want to know what each person is doing. It's not so clear that the *meeting* is really what matters here (and quite likely your manager has quite enough meetings in their diary anyway).

..  sidebar::

    Then, think about what they actually *need*.

Why would your manager want to know what each person is doing? Why is being aware of progress at that level so important? Ask yourself: does it seem appropriate for a manager to have that level of oversight?

If not, you might conclude that some anxiety is at work. Perhaps your manager feels that there is a lack of accountability for progress in the team, or that planning has been slack, and so the only way to judge progress is by watching it very closely.

You can ask about this:

    Would it help if I were to provide a daily written summary of activities and outcomes, and if there are any blockers, to make sure to let you know straight away? Perhaps then you wouldn't need to find a slot for a daily meeting just for this project.

That's an appropriate way to question a manager's decision. It suggests an alternative and offers to take responsibility for making it work. Or:

    I think it would also help if we had a more concrete plan, with a timeline for interim delivery of the key dependencies. I did one for project yyy. I made a draft for this one too - would you like to see it?

Again, this demonstrates initiative and a positive attitude towards a situation.

In the end, it might be that in fact your manager really *does* want to see everyone daily (perhaps they want to assess the team's performance and professional communication skills), but the important thing is for you to get into the habit of **thinking beyond the immediate ask, to thinking about what really matters and why**.


Example: a job description
--------------------------

Suppose that a job description demands "three years' Python web agency experience".

..  sidebar::

    When they ask for something, consider what they really want.

They *asked for* "three years' Python web agency experience". Perhaps you have that, or not. Either way, think about what it says about what they *want*.

They want evidence of Python web experience, almost certainly. And most likely they *want* someone who has proven ability to deal with customer requests, deadlines and so on - because those are the kind of things someone who works for an agency has to be able to do. In that case, you might be able to do those things, even if you can't show precisely the agency experience what they asked for.

..  sidebar::

    Then, think about what they actually *need*.

Very often, prospective employers want proof and evidence. They want signs that you are going to have the right skills, abilities and attitudes in the job. But, perhaps there are other things that could show you have what they *need*.

*Why* do they want the things they want? What needs do you see revealed? What else do you have that could be evidence you will be able to meet the needs?

In this particular case, perhaps you conclude that they want evidence of Python web experience, and of ability to work with customers' needs.

Reading between the lines, listening carefully how they talk about it, you might come to the conclusion that what they really *need* is someone who is good at coming up with pragmatic prototypes, quickly.

Get used to asking questions inspired by what you think you are hearing. Good questions unlock hidden treasure. If you ask a question based on an insightful conclusion, people will often reward it with very concrete information: "That's right! Quick prototyping is exactly the kind of thing we'll need." Then they reveal that they'll need more people on a big Django project that is expected to go through several phases of development, with a customer whose own plans are subject to change.

And that gives you something else you can talk about and show.


Make it clear to yourself

Spending a little time to write this out can really help crystallise it.
