"I don't always feel that you are well-prepared for our one-to-one "

msgid ""
"When people give you feedback, they don't always make the judgement and "

"high quality feedback generally gives both, explicitly). So, sometimes "
"you have to do the work to add the missing dimension."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dealing-with-feedback.rst:41
msgid ""
"That work could include following up with someone. For example quite "
"often when you get positive feedback, people just leave it at a positive "

"It doesn't just help clarify what you need to *do*, you can use it with "

"It also shows up clearly when feedback is incomplete. For example, if you"
