"One of the most valuable things you can do is get in the habit of "

"The premise is simple. You will not get ahead in your career because you "
"have skills or experience, or because you did your job well, or worked "
"very hard. What will count in the end is *value* - the value that you "
"create and the value that someone judges that you will bring."

"But, it is not always easy to think like this. We tend to think how hard "

"Value also isn't really easy to define, though it's very recognisable "
"when you see it. The best way to arrive at it is through the question: "

"When applying for a job you will need to have multiple examples of value "
"ready to hand, to answer questions and to show how you will behave in the"
" situations that you'll have to face. And when you're in a job, the "
"question of the value you bring will come up over and over again: when "
"you have a period performance or pay review, when you apply for a "
"promotion, when you make a request for something."

#: ../../recording-value.rst:59
msgid ""
"The structure is important. First of all, it separates the **effort** - "
"the action you took - from the **value** - the result you obtained. They "
"are different dimensions of what you did."
msgstr ""

#: ../../recording-value.rst:61
msgid ""
"To a certain extent the *effort* is your perception of what you did - "
"your story - but the *result* is an objective - literally measurable if "
"possible - thing that you brought about in the world. Any observer should"
" be able to agree on the result."
msgstr ""

#: ../../recording-value.rst:63
msgid ""
"The **sphere** is the third dimension. It's the bigger picture or the "
"values, that give the result meaning. They are why you took the action "
"and why we care about the result. You should be able to say \"I believe "
"in...\" of each of them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../recording-value.rst:65
msgid ""
"It's important to include the sphere. One reason is that it helps you see"
" more clearly where you are succeeding in creating value and where "
"perhaps not - for example, you might notice that you don't have good "
"examples of helping others. And, putting each one in a particular sphere "
"this way helps remind you, when you need to come up with an example, why "
"the things you have done matter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../recording-value.rst:67
msgid ""
"Include the date you **started** the effort, just to make sure you can "
"pin it down in time and give it firm reality in your mind, and the date "
"you **noted** the result - when you reflected on what you did and its "
"value, and decided it was something you should be proud to have "
"associated with you."

msgid ""
"In interviews you will hear many questions that start: \"Tell me about a "

msgid ""
"It's important to get in the habit of thinking about the things you do in"
" terms of value, and to create for yourself a record of them. You might "
"imagine you will remember these things, but you will not. What is more, "
"the act of recording them as advised is what will help frame actions and "
"incidents that you can actually use."

"Everyone has examples from their work and life that they *could* use to "
"illustrate a time when they demonstrated customer focus, or show how they"
" would how they would deal with a difficult colleague, or give an example"
" of helping improve a a team process. But unless they have a way of "
"*recording* those examples, that helps keep them alive in their minds, it"
" won't actually happen."

msgid ""
"In work, you will have performance reviews, in which you're asked to "
"reflect on your own performance. Being armed with specific, concrete "
"examples that illustrate the qualities you want to show and the progress "
"you have made helps you do that much more effectively. It's one thing to "
"say \"I am pleased with the progress I made to understand our team "
