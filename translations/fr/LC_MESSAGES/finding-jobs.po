"An effective job hunter keeps up with the daily stream of notices and "
"advertisements, and also builds up an understanding of the longer-term "
"trends and patterns. (In this respect it's rather like being a keen "
"follower of current affairs - you need to keep up-to-date with the news, "
"of events as they happen, and also with the longer-term story in which "
"they occur.)"
