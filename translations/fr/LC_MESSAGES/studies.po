"The popularity of Computer Science as a degree means that there an awful "

"That's not attractive to a potential employer. The CS graduate who merely"

" only on what their studies required them to tackle."

"On the other hand, someone who threw themselves into their studies, and "
"especially someone who eagerly took opportunities to use or create "
"software as part of their studies (whatever the degree subject) is much "

"opportunity for someone to demonstrate software skills in subjects all "

"Don't be afraid to go beyond your curriculum. University programs often "
"lag behind industry practices, with courses rarely covering many "

"computing world evolves rapidly, so identify what's relevant to your "

"At university, there are clubs and societies related to all kinds of "

msgid ""
"There are several reasons why it's especially valuable to seek out open-"
"source software while you are university. There are many barriers to "
"open-source software, and this is a time when you are most likely to "
"encounter others for whom it is a passion, who have knowledge to share, "
"and the time to share it, helping you over those barriers. It's much "
"easier to get deep into the exploration and experimentation, and the "
"troubleshooting that comes with them, when you are surrounded by others "
"also embarked on the same journey."
msgstr ""

#: ../../studies.rst:102
msgid ""
"For your studies too, open-source software has much to offer. It's one "
"thing to deliver a competent project using the standard, recommended "
"tools; it's quite another to use and adapt an open-source package as part"
" of a project. While at university it's often hard to imagine making an "
"impact on other people - but if you can get over the initial barriers to "
"engagement, open-source opens an opportunity for real contribution and "
"recognition, and that is something that will really stand out in a "
"candidate's profile - whatever their degree subject."
msgstr ""

#: ../../studies.rst:106
msgid ""
"In practice **any degree that allows you to demonstrate technical "
"competence will have value when applying for a job**. Whatever the degree"

"In that case, you will have to draw on other achievements and successes "
"in software. Sometimes, having attained them despite not having done the "
"degree can help you stand out. You still need to have attained the "
"success though - and it needs to be success as substantial as a degree."
