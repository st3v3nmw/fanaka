"When you're applying for a job, at some point someone is going to look "
"you up on the web - to verify something you've said, to learn more or "

msgid ""
"Let's start with a very simple principle: there should be nothing online "
"representing you that could be embarrassing if a prospective employer "
"were to see it. What comes up if you search for yourself, on different "
"search engines, and when you look past the first page of results?"

"What people see online is what most of them will see first, and it's what"

"online."

#: ../../online-presence.rst:27
msgid ""
"Everyone is entitled to have passions and beliefs, even strong beliefs "
"and opinions. There's nothing wrong with being - for example - a "
"political activist or a fanatical sports enthusiast, but how you conduct "
"yourself in those pursuits really matters. You must do it politely, "

msgid ""
"You should not be writing or participating in anything anywhere online "

"Previous generations enjoyed a luxury: mistakes they made would generally"

"Consider deleting old posts and comments, if you're not happy about them,"

msgid ""
"If you have the time and energy to maintain it, a website of your own is "
"a valuable thing. (Depending how you do it, you can be responsible for "
"every aspect of it from design to deployment, and that in itself "

"What do you want to put on it? First of all, be aware that it's very easy"

"the momentum."
msgstr ""

#: ../../online-presence.rst:79
msgid ""
"Interviewers are very used to looking up a candidate's website, and "
"finding that it contains a rush of articles that were all written within "
"six weeks of each other, three years ago. (The other thing they often see"
" is that the site is very new, and that every article shows every sign of"
" having been created solely to be a portfolio while job-hunting.)"

"If you're going to create your own website, *start sooner rather than "

"Guides can be very simple (\"Create a network back-up system using a "
"Raspberry Pi\"), but even simple things will find an audience, and if you"
" are able to write something up more clearly than anyone else has, it "
"will be appreciated. It's quite something to hit the front page of "
"`HackerNews <https://news.ycombinator.com>`_ in that way."
msgstr ""

#: ../../online-presence.rst:93
msgid ""
"If what you have written catches an interviewer's eye, expect to be asked"
" about it - interviewers love seeing candidates' public work like that."
msgstr ""

#: ../../online-presence.rst:95
msgid ""
"But, there is a difficulty: coming up with articles of that kind is a "
"very difficult effort to sustain, and doing it with authority and quality"
" makes it harder still.  There's a good way to turn it round though, by "
"choosing *not* to write from a position of authority."

msgid ""
"Instead, an excellent thing you can do (especially if you are in an early"
" career stage) is use your website as *a public diary of your learning "
"and exploration*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../online-presence.rst:103
msgid ""
"It will be just as effective as writing guides for others, and you can "
"even cover the same content, but now you are freer, to make it about your"
" journey. You can go into your missteps and failures too. You'll feel "
"less need to write something new that hasn't been written about before, "
"because this time it's about your perspective and experience."
msgstr ""

#: ../../online-presence.rst:105
msgid ""
"For an interviewer, it demonstrates how you develop your skills and work "

#: ../../online-presence.rst:107
msgid ""
"You'll be able to write just the same article about the Raspberry Pi "
"network back-up system, but it will be easier, *and that means you are "

msgid "Open-source activity"
msgstr ""

#: ../../online-presence.rst:113
msgid ""
"If you take part in software projects, communities or initiatives, then "
"to a certain extent that automatically creates a presence for you (your "
"trail of activity on platforms such as Github, or the way your name will "
"show up on events' websites)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../online-presence.rst:115
msgid ""
"This can be of immense value, and it's also easy to amplify - for example"

msgid "LinkedIn"
msgstr ""

#: ../../online-presence.rst:121
msgid ""
"Everyone seems to be on LinkedIn. You might as well. You will "
"occasionally see things of interest, and if you have met or encountered "
"someone in the field that you're interested in working in, it's "
"worthwhile to try to establish the connection. It *can* be a good way to "
"ask someone a direct question if you don't already have their email "
"address."
msgstr ""

#: ../../online-presence.rst:123
msgid ""
"But be realistic. You can't expect anything of someone just because "
"you're connected on LinkedIn. You are very unlikely to be able to "
"cultivate meaningful professional relationships on LinkedIn; that will "
"generally happen elsewhere."
msgstr ""

#: ../../online-presence.rst:125
msgid ""
"And be aware that there is a vast amount of rubbish on the platform too: "
"appalling advice, horrible values and shallow \"aspiration\". There's a "

"<https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkedInLunatics/>`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../online-presence.rst:127
msgid ""
"If you have a LinkedIn account, it's worth mentioning it on your CV and "
"in job applications (many application forms ask, and many reviewers will "
"have a look at your LinkedIn page). Make sure your LinkedIn page looks "
"professional and matches your CV."
msgstr ""

msgid "Social media"
msgstr ""

#: ../../online-presence.rst:133
msgid ""
"Fewer people than ever now use Twitter, which once was a place for fairly"
" casual conversation about software and the industry. It's unlikely that "
"you will obtain any benefit from investing effort into maintaining a "
"presence there, or on FaceBook. You'll find more software industry "
"engagement on Mastodon and Bluesky, but it's fragmented."

msgid "Your usernames"
msgstr ""

#: ../../online-presence.rst:139
msgid ""
"As with your :ref:`email address <your-cv-email>`, the username for your "
