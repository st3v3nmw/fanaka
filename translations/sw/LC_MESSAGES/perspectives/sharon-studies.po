"I don't have a software background. I studied Economics and Statistics "
"and enjoyed it, but almost halfway through my degree, I began to doubt if"
" I had made the best choice. In my first year of university, a friend "
"introduced me to programming. I didn't have a computer and barely knew "
"how to use one, but I've never forgotten the joy I felt. I knew "
"immediately that I wanted to do more of that."

"I wanted to become a “computer expert” and decided I needed to study "
"Computer Science instead. But I would forfeit the Kenyan government "
"sponsorship I already had, and it would be unaffordably expensive (I "
"didn't even dare mention it to my parents). There was another option: a "
"degree at a U.S. university - if I could obtain financial assistance to "
"cover all the costs."

"I interrupted my studies to earn some money, and focused on applying for "
"opportunities offered by U.S. colleges. I did writing jobs; I managed to "
"buy a laptop; I studied for and took U.S. examinations, and made multiple"
" applications to universities. And eventually, I received an offer, "
"including financial aid - but it would only cover 75% of the costs. I "
"would need to find another USD 22000 each year, which was out of the "
"question for me."

"I found that some things worked well and some didn't. I discovered that I"
" was too impatient for videos and learned better from books. I did not "
"feel welcome at some meetups. I observed a clique mentality, and saw an "
"unwillingness to help others. I even saw some individuals lording over "
"others and using their positions of leadership and expertise to demean "
"people, or gain favours in exchange for help, and I realised that "
"communities without effective policies could be undermined by the "
"behaviour of individuals."

"If I could turn back time to when I was a fresh school-leaver, I would do"
