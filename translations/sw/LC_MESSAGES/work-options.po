"Maybe you feel you will have more value earning a higher salary to send "
"money back home, or perhaps that being part of a local technology "
"community matters more. Living in Europe might be a wonderful adventure "

"the most important thing you can do is apply your software skills to "
"African problems. Different things might matter to you more than others."
