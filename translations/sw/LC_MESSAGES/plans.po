"*SMART* is a catchy acronym, but it's merely a list. Worse, no-one can "

"the urge to add additional ones, so we end up with \"improved\" schemes, "

"unmemorable formats. That's not to mention all the competing notions, "
"like *CLEAR*, *ABC*, etc."

"This scheme is not arbitrary. Also, because it clearly describes the "
"necessary dimensions of a plan as independent of each other, it makes it "
"possible to see for example which particular elements time applies to, "
"and how (whereas *SMART* simply implies that a plan must be time-related,"
" which is both vague and misleading)."
