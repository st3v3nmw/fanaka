msgid ""
"Someone who is new to a workplace or role quite can quite naturally feel "

"It's tempting then to think that *not* getting corrective feedback, not "
"being questioned or challenged, is a good sign. It might feel safer not "
"to be noticed or have your work scrutinised. You might think: \"No news "

"If your performance at work is not being challenged or questioned, it's "

"If you are making a visible, spectacular, unignorable mess of things, "

" is for other people not to confront it, even if it's not up to the "
"required standard."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-feedback.rst:66
msgid ""
"They will tell themselves that your substandard performance is not an "
"urgent matter. They will ignore it in the hope that it will rectify "

"At the same time, for the person whose work is at risk of not meeting "
"standards, it's also easier to do nothing, to stay quiet, and to keep "
"their head down. If you're not completely sure that everything you're "
"doing is up to scratch, why risk drawing attention to it? By next week "
"you might have it figured out."

msgid ""
"And so on. Nobody wants to bring a problem to the surface. Everybody "
"hopes it will go away. Everyone will look for the easy, uncomplicated "
"path. It's like a conspiracy of inaction. Every human instinct combines "
"to prevent a confrontation with underperformance - and then suddenly one "
"day it will be unavoidable, and quite possibly, **too late to save the "
"day**."

msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-feedback.rst:84
msgid ""
"When things get bad, a person who is anxious about how they're doing is "
"likely to go into *survival mode*, in which getting through the day "
"without having faced difficult questions or critical comment feels like a"
" kind of success. Of course you can avoid getting negative feedback by "
"avoiding *any* feedback."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-feedback.rst:86
msgid ""
"Now you really are locked into a spiral of doom. It's amazing how "
"effectively someone who fears feedback can avoid or delay receiving it, "
"mostly through unconscious strategies and the signals they give out to "
"other people. It's hard enough for many to give negative feedback in the "
"first place. Someone who is actively avoiding it - even without realising"
" that that is what they are doing - is likely to crash, without ever "
"having reached out for the one thing that could help them, all the while "
"telling themselves that they are surviving."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-feedback.rst:88
msgid ""
"Asking for feedback can be a terribly hard thing to do when you already "
"sense that things aren't going well, but it is the first and necessary "

"On the converse side, if you are doing well, **you need your good "

#: ../../getting-feedback.rst:96
msgid ""
"You need feedback and insight, so that you know *what* you're doing "

"Work that represents an excellent start for someone in a junior position "
"will not be adequate for the same person once they are settled in; you "
"need to keep raising the quality and value of your work. That requires a "
"lot more than the occasional nod of approval from a senior. It requires "
"active, close engagement, with multiple people, who are able to give your"
" work real attention, thought and time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-feedback.rst:100
msgid ""
"Once again the conspiracy of inaction can creep up on you here. Someone "
"starts well, gets good feedback and continues sailing along happily. But "
"the expectations don't remain the same, and neither you nor the people "
"around you will notice immediately if you begin to fall short of them. "
"Now, alarm bells should be ringing if you're not getting feedback."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-feedback.rst:102
msgid ""
"To know that things are going well, you need to be getting positive "

msgid ""
"Record it, so you know that you are getting it, from who and how much. It"
" will also help you see patterns that show where you need to turn your "

"feedback - that others are noticing your work, and caring about it and "
"about you."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-feedback.rst:112
msgid ""
"Normalising it also helps make it easier for you to get feedback when it "
"really matters, when it's going to help you, and makes receiving "
"feedback, even the dreaded negative feedback, easier."

"Getting feedback is crucial - but you also need to :ref:`deal with "
"feedback effectively <dealing-with-feedback>`."
