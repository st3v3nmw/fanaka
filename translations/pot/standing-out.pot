msgid "To be considered for a role you must *conform*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../standing-out.rst:23
msgid "You must conform to the prospective employer's expectations, of skills, experience, qualifications. You must conform to the way hiring processes work. :ref:`Your CV <your-cv>` must conform to expectations of length, style, content. **You have to give them what they want.**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../standing-out.rst:25
msgid "This can be hard, especially if you're not already an industry insider. You might not even know or understand some of those expectations, or that you have somehow completely failed to meet them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../standing-out.rst:27
msgid "Some of them might even be unfair expectations, for example if an African woman does not fit a recruiter's unconscious idea of \"what a database engineer looks like\"."

msgid "And somehow, at the same time, you must *stand out*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../standing-out.rst:31
msgid "To be selected, you need to stand out from all the other candidates. You don't just need to *be* the best-suited to the role, you need to find ways to *show* that effectively. You have to catch the eye, and be remembered. **Give them something that perhaps they didn't even realise they could have.**"

msgid "Let's say that you realise that the company needs someone with **solid Python experience** in a **cloud data analytics** environment. How can you show that you fit in, *and* stand out?"

msgid "Fit in"
msgstr ""

#: ../../standing-out.rst:46
msgid "I re-implemented all our data analytics pipelines in Apache Airflow, with Kubernetes and Helm. I gave them a consistent interface, and that made a significant difference to the speed and reliability of our teams' work with them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../standing-out.rst:48
msgid "You show that you know the tools. By talking about them in a sophisticated way, you demonstrate a depth of understanding. You connect the work to production concerns - in this case, how it makes a difference to other teams."

msgstr ""

#: ../../standing-out.rst:76
msgid "After I showed management how the developer documentation was failing to turn curious experimenters into paying customers, they accepted my proposal to overhaul it entirely - which improved conversion rates from less than 1% to nearly 7% in three months."
msgstr ""

#: ../../standing-out.rst:78
msgid "You show that you are not just a passive technical writer but one who sees things that need to be improved, and will take the initiative to make the improvements happen. You demonstrate persuasiveness, hint at persistence and highlight measurable success."

msgid "Why this is so effective"
msgstr ""

#: ../../standing-out.rst:84
msgid "The statements that show how you *fit in* help to answer people's questions even before they need to ask you."
msgstr ""

#: ../../standing-out.rst:86
msgid "They'll be thinking: *Does the candidate have the Docker experience we need?* And they will answer it for themselves: *Look at that, five years working with Docker!*"

msgid "The ones that show how you *stand out* prompt them to ask you certain questions - the questions *you* want them to ask."
msgstr ""

#: ../../standing-out.rst:90
msgid "Your story will make them wonder: *How did you persuade management? How did you measure the conversion rates?* And when they ask, you can truly say:  *I'm glad you asked me that!*"

msgid "If you can get to an interview, and you have effectively *already* answered the questions they need answered, and you have given them questions that you know are going to make you shine, you have put yourself in an excellent position."

msgid "How to use this pattern"
msgstr ""

#: ../../standing-out.rst:98
msgid "You can use this way of looking at what's being asked of you equally when you have time to stop and think - for example when you're revising your CV for a particular role, or submitting your initial application - or when you're on the spot in an interview."
msgstr ""

#: ../../standing-out.rst:100
msgid "It's harder to do it on the spot, but if you have already thought it through beforehand, and have some notes written down, you will find that in the moment, some good things to say will come to mind. So, begin by applying it to the role as soon as you start looking at it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../standing-out.rst:104
msgid "What a job description or even an interviewer asks for are not necessarily what the job needs. Learn to :ref:`read between the lines <between-the-lines>`, and think about what's really at stake."
msgstr ""

#: ../../standing-out.rst:106
msgid "Note each key thing that the job requires. These are the points where you need to fit in and stand out. Between five and ten should be enough (any more than that and you might risk losing sight of the picture)."

msgid "And now find the connected things that they weren't expecting but will please them, the things that you hope will elevate you above the other candidates. Be surprising and be specific."
msgstr ""

#: ../../standing-out.rst:122
msgid "Draw on what's special to you, and draw on your African experience. For example, in an interview about web performance, you could note that as an African you are immediately aware of the challenges of using the web on under-powered equipment in slow network conditions, and the approaches you use to ensure good performance for all users (and you might be surprised how surprising that is to some interviewers)."
