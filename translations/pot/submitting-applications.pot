msgid "It's true that they save a lot of time and effort. Instead of painstakingly finding open jobs, thinking about them and how you might fit, deciding on what you want to do and then carefully doing it, which takes real time, you can get a machine to do twenty of them for you in a few seconds."

msgid "The reality is: **many of these services are literally worse than junk.** Not only will they fail to help you get a job, they will harm your *future* chances."
msgstr ""

#: ../../submitting-applications.rst:35
msgid "For example, some will make up answers to questions on application forms, often answers that are obviously false, or otherwise guarantee you will not be selected to go to the next step in the process."

msgid "For the company that's hiring, applications are often quite recognisable - they all look the same - and can lead to your name ending up on a company's blacklist."

msgid "For example, if there is a link in a job advertisement for a documentation author to \"Our documentation strategy\", *read it*, attentively. A single thing they say could be enough of a clue for you to decide to reword something in your CV. Or you might notice that they emphasise something that was barely mentioned in the advertisement itself. You can also spot red flags this way, signs that the company or role might not work for you so well."

Their knowledge and insight will be far more valuable. You might discover that at this company, they will quiz you at length about your education, or that they always ask for references, or that they are very impressed with people who have made open source software contributions.

#: ../../submitting-applications.rst:106
msgid "Beyond the basics, an application form often has some questions for you related to the job itself. Those questions are your first chance to show how you :ref:`fit the description, or stand out amongst other candidates <standing_out>` (this is why the \"services\" that claim to apply for you going to let you down).

#: ../../submitting-applications.rst:149
msgid "The covering letter is where you make yourself stand out, as an individual, with your own personality and characteristics. It should say things that are **not** in the CV.

I love the way it handles <problem yyy> but I have often thought about how <zzz> could be improved."

#: ../../submitting-applications.rst:168
msgid "I've known about <company> for a few years, but earlier this year I was at <some conference> in Lagos and <company> was the only European company represented there. What really impressed me was learning about <xxx from yyy> at the sponsor booth. It would be my dream to contribute to that."

msgstr ""

msgid "Unfortunately as a candidate you must get used to all kinds of disrespectful behaviour. Candidates also behave in increasingly disrespectful ways."
msgstr ""

#: ../../submitting-applications.rst:190
msgid "It's like an arms race of discourtesy. Companies get so many applications that they use automated systems and AI to do some of the work of assessing them. In turn candidates use automated systems to create their applications and submit them in vast numbers. The automated systems don't care if the jobs they're applying for are completely unsuitable. Candidates let LLMs make up lies on their behalf. Hiring managers will engage an application in earnest conversation by email before cancelling an interview at a moment's notice and then never again replying to the bewildered candidate's messages."
