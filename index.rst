Opportunities
=============

**Africans are well-placed for opportunities in the global software industry.**

Africans typically speak English and other European languages to a high standard. They are served by many good universities. Reliable and reasonably fast Internet connections are available in most African cities. African time zones are ideal for remote workers in European organisations.


Challenges
==========

At the same time, Africans also face some challenges.

Relatively, their numbers in the industry are very low. That means it's harder for them to understand some of its expectations, and also for companies in the industry to understand the particular cultural contexts of African candidates. Similar gaps in familiarity and experience can make it harder for them to succeed once they are in.

    *Fanaka* means *success* in Kiswahili, one of the most-widely spoken languages in Africa.

*Fanaka* is a handbook for prospective and early-career professionals in the industry. It aims to cover some of the gaps, and help people work across them to success.

It's based on years of experience: of African professionals who have successfully navigated the challenges, and also of the colleagues who have worked with them and can offer insight and advice from the other side of the table.
